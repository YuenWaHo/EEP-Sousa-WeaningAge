## Abstract
Weaning represents a pivotal ontogenetic process for mammals, marking the transition from parental provisioning to independent foraging.  In monophyodont species, distinct growth layer groups (GLGs) that are deposited in their teeth as the animals age represent a permanent chronological archive of physiological events across the animal’s lifetime.  Thus, biochemical analysis of annual dentine increments provide means to explore the animal’s physiological history.  We examined the age-specific pattern, individual-level variations, and sex-related differences in dentine nitrogen isotopic values in the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) using tooth samples collected from 38 carcasses that stranded ashore in the Pearl River Delta region, southeast China, between 2007 to 2018. The longitudinal isotopic records archived in dolphin teeth offered insight into their foraging ecology and individual ontogenetic dietary life history. The overall pattern of δ15N isotopic values in the incremental layers, analyzed under a hierarchical Bayesian framework, indicates that humpback dolphins typically undergo an ontogenetic dietary shift (i.e., wean) before reaching the age of three years (mean 2.394 ± 0.143 years), albeit there is a considerable individual heterogeneity (ranging from 1.548 to 4.180 years), with males weaning consistently ~3.5 months earlier than females. Our study underscores the importance of quantifying ontogenetic parameters at the individual level as individual variations in life history events (such as the age of weaning) may affect broader population-level life history metrics. The application of hierarchical Bayesian modeling proved effective in quantifying individual heterogeneity and factoring it into the estimates of ontogenetic dietary  shifts — an important component in analyses of broader population-level processes.

## Software implementation
All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in the `EEP-sousa-weaning.ipynb`.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
We have decided not to include the data in the current manuscript as it is being used for an ongoing study which will result in subsequent publications.
